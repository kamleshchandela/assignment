    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet (H1)</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Early computers</b> were groundbreaking machines that laid the foundation for modern technology. Long before today's sleek laptops and smartphones, computing began with simple tools like the <strong>abacus</strong>, used for basic arithmetic thousands of years ago. In the 17th century, inventors like <i>Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Leibniz</i> created mechanical calculators that could perform addition, subtraction, and even multiplication. The real leap came in the 19th century when <u>Charles</u> Babbage conceptualized the Analytical Engine—a design that included components similar to today’s CPU and memory. Though it was never built in his lifetime, it marked the birth of programmable computing. In the 20th century, machines like the <strong>ENIAC</strong> emerged, using vacuum tubes to perform complex calculations at unprecedented speeds. These early computers were massive, power-hungry, and limited in capability, but they revolutionized <i>science</i>, <i>warfare</i>, and <i>industry</i>. Over time, the invention of <strong>transistors</strong> and <strong>microprocessors</strong> made computers smaller, faster, and more accessible, leading to the digital age we live in today.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>.By the 4th generation, computers became <em>personal and affordable</em>.

    <h3>Mathematics in Computing</h3>
    <p>
    A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
    Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.
    </p>
    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented byTim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
<blockquote cite="Tim Berners-Lee">
   "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." 
</blockquote>
    </p>
    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber connections. Computers now fit in our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>.
    </p>
    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        To display text on a webpage, you can use:
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;code&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Hello World
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    
    </pre>
    <p>
        Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text.

    </p>
    <p>
        System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
